Description: The 'probaverse' is a suite of packages designed to facilitate
    creating advanced statistical models through probability distributions.
    These packages work best when loaded together because they share a common
    design philosophy and focus on different aspects of developing statistical
    models. Inspired by the 'tidyverse' package, the 'probaverse' package
    makes it easy to load the entire suite of 'probaverse' packages together.
