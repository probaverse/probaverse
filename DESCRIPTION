Description: The probaverse is a suite of packages to facilitate
    working with probability distributions in R. Each package
    focusses on a specific task that's large enough for the scope
    of an individual package. Because the packages are most useful
    when loaded together, the `probaverse` package exists for loading
    these packages in one swoop.
