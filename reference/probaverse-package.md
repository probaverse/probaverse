# probaverse: Install and Load the 'Probaverse' Packages

The 'probaverse' is a suite of packages designed to facilitate creating
advanced statistical models through probability distributions. These
packages work best when loaded together because they share a common
design philosophy and focus on different aspects of developing
statistical models. Inspired by the 'tidyverse' package, the
'probaverse' package makes it easy to load the entire suite of
'probaverse' packages together.
