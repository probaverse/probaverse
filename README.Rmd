The probaverse is a suite of packages that facilitate working with probability distributions. Since they all work in harmony and are better when loaded together, the `probaverse` package exists for loading these packages.

Loading `probaverse` is the best way to interact with the packages as many of the packages are under active development.

## Installation

The `probaverse` package is not on CRAN yet. You can install the development version of probaverse like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # Do you need to install `remotes`?
remotes::install_github("probaverse/probaverse")
```

## Example

`probaverse` will load:

- [`distionary`](https://distionary.probaverse.com): create and evaluate probability distributiuns.
- [`distplyr`](https://distplyr.probaverse.com): manipulate probability distributions.
- [`famish`](https://famish.probaverse.com): estimate probability distribution from data.
- `uscore` (being phased out for `gristmill`: data-based probability distributions).

Eventually, `couple` will be added to the mix, too, for building dependence models with copulas.

Load the probaverse packages like so.

```{r}
library(probaverse)
```
