- Use `<-` for assignment, not `=`
- Use `snake_case` for function and variable names
- Keep lines to a maximum of 80 characters
- Add spaces around operators (`x + y`, not `x+y`)
- Add spaces after commas (`f(x, y)`, not `f(x,y)`)


### Documentation Style

- All exported functions must have complete roxygen2 documentation
- Include `@param` for all parameters with clear descriptions
- Include `@return` describing what the function returns
- Include `@examples` with working examples
- Use proper markdown formatting in documentation
